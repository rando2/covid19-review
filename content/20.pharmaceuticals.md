### Introduction

The novel coronavirus _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2_ (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and quickly precipitated the worldwide spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
<!--I never know whether to emphasize that this is the CFR and not the IFR. Both are also time and population-dependent...-->
COVID-19 is associated with symptoms ranging from mild or even asymptomatic to severe, and approximately 2% of patients die from COVID-19-related complications such as acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) [@individual-pathogenesis].
As a result, public health guidelines have been critical to efforts to control the spread of the virus.
However, as of early 2021, COVID-19 remains a significant worldwide concern (Figure @fig:csse-deaths), with cases in some regions surging far above the numbers reported during the initial outbreak in early 2020.
While a number of vaccines have been developed and approved in different countries starting in December 2020 [@individual-vaccines], vaccination efforts have not proceeded at the same pace throughout the world and are not yet close to ending the pandemic.
Due to the continued threat of the virus and the severity of the disease, the identification and development of therapeutic interventions have emerged as significant international priorities.
Prior developments during other recent outbreaks of emerging diseases, especially those caused by human coronaviruses (HCoV), have provided a number of hypotheses guiding a biomedical approach to the behavior and treatment of this novel coronavirus infection.
However, previous emerging HCoV-related disease threats have been controlled much more quickly than SARS-CoV-2 through public health efforts (Figure @fig:csse-deaths), which has made the repurposing and development of pharmaceuticals uniquely important in the face of this crisis.

#### Lessons from Prior HCoV Outbreaks

**Cumulative global COVID-19 deaths since January 22, 2020.**
{{csse_deaths}} COVID-19 deaths had been reported worldwide as of {{csse_date_pretty}} (Figure @fig:csse-deaths).
Data are from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University [@https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series].
Previous emergent viral threats had a much lower death toll that was not felt on a such a global scale, and in most cases were controlled much more quickly.
For example, SARS-CoV-1 was controlled within 9 months of its appearance, whereas SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant global threat almost 1.5 years later.
]({{csse_deaths_figure}} "Global COVID-19 deaths"){#fig:csse-deaths secno=1}

SARS-CoV-2's rapid shift from an unknown virus to a significant worldwide threat initially closely paralleled the emergence of _Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (SARS-CoV-1).
The first documented case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China in November 2019, and the disease quickly spread worldwide during the early months of 2020.
In comparison, the first case of SARS was reported in November 2002 in the Guangdong Province of China, and it spread within China and then into several countries across continents during the first half of 2003 [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029; @doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81; @doi:10.3390/ijerph17113973].
In fact, genome sequencing quickly revealed the virus causing COVID-19 to be a novel betacoronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-1 [@doi:10.46234/ccdcw2020.017].
While similarities between these two viruses are unsurprising given their close phylogenetic relationship, there are also some differences in how the viruses affect humans.
SARS-CoV-1 infection is severe, with an estimated case fatality rate (CFR) for SARS of 9.5% [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029], while estimates of the CFR associated with COVID-19 are much lower, at approximately 2% [@individual-pathogenesis].
SARS-CoV-1 is highly contagious via droplet transmission and has a basic reproduction number (R~0~) of 4 (i.e., each person infected was estimated to infect four other people) [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
<!--We should say at minimum that there's debate over droplets vs aerosols, as seen for instance in this https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00869-2/fulltext?hss_channel=tw-27013292 and the resulting controversy-->
SARS-CoV-2 also appears to be spread primarily by droplet transmission [@doi:10.1001/jama.2020.12458; @doi:10/gg6br7], and most estimates of its R~0~ fall between 2.5 and 3 [@individual-pathogenesis].
<!--I took out the rest of this sentence, as it didn't seem to flow quite right to me. We mention later that SARS actually led to fewer deaths, in a way that seems more logical flow-wise.-->
Therefore, SARS is thought to be a deadlier and more transmissible disease than COVID-19.

The 17-year difference in the timing of these two outbreaks led to some major differences in the tools available to the international community in organizing a response.
At the time that SARS-CoV-1 emerged, no new HCoV had been identified in almost 40 years [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
The identity of the virus underlying the SARS disease remained unknown until April of 2003, when the SARS-CoV-1 virus was characterized through a worldwide scientific effort spearheaded by the World Health Organization (WHO) [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was released on January 3, 2020 [@doi:10.46234/ccdcw2020.017], only days after the international community became aware of the novel pneumonia-like illness now known as COVID-19.
While SARS-CoV-1 belonged to a distinct lineage from the two other HCoVs known at the time of its discovery [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029], SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV-1 and a more distant relative of another HCoV characterized in 2012 that causes severe disease, _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (MERS) [@doi:10/ggjr43; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1211721].
Before the recognition of COVID-19, significant efforts had already been devoted to characterizing these two devastating HCoVs in order to better understand how they interact with human hosts.
Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 emerged under very different circumstances than SARS-CoV-1 in terms of scientific knowledge about HCoVs and the tools available to characterize them.

Despite the apparent advantages for responding to SARS-CoV-2 infections, the trajectory of COVID-19 has led to a much larger number of deaths than that of either SARS or MERS (Figure @fig:csse-deaths).
By July 2003, the SARS outbreak was officially determined to be under control, with the success credited to infection management practices such as mask wearing [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
MERS is still circulating and remains a concern; although the fatality rate is very high at almost 35%, the disease is much less easily transmitted, as its R~0~ has been estimated to be 1 [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
The low R~0~ in combination with public health practices allowed for its spread to be contained [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029].
Neither of these trajectories are comparable to that of SARS-CoV-2, which remains a serious threat worldwide almost a year and a half after the first cases of COVID-19 emerged, despite the lower mortality rates for infected individuals.

### Potential Approaches to the Treatment of COVID-19

Today, many different approaches are available for identifying existing pharmaceuticals or candidate compounds that might be useful in mitigating the effects of a viral infection.
Two common therapeutic strategies are to either reduce the symptoms that are harmful to patients or hinder the spread of infection by targeting a virus directly.
The goal of the former is to reduce the severity and risks of an active infection, while for the latter, it is to inhibit the replication of the virus once an individual is infected, potentially freezing disease progression.
The identification of potential therapeutics against an emerging disease or a novel virus can proceed through either drug repurposing or drug development.
Drug repurposing involves identifying an existing compound that may provide benefits in the context of interest [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.168].
This strategy can focus on either approved or investigational drugs, for which there may be applicable preclinical or safety information [@doi:10.1038/nrd.2018.168].
Drug development, on the other hand, provides an opportunity to identify or develop a compound specifically relevant to a particular need, but it is often a lengthy and expensive process characterized by repeated failure [@doi:10.1016/j.trci.2017.10.005].
Drug repurposing therefore tends to be emphasized in a situation like the COVID-19 pandemic due to the potential for a more rapid response.

Even from the early months of the pandemic, studies began releasing results of analyzing approved and investigational drugs in the context of COVID-19.
<!--I edited this because technically observational studies can also include only cases (compared to some historical standard for example)-->
The rapid timescale of this response meant that, initially, most evidence came from observational studies, which consider treatments assigned in the course of regular care, for instance by comparing groups of patients who did and did not receive a treatment to determine whether it may have an effect.
This type of study can be conducted rapidly but is subject to confounding, for example if certain treatments tend to be assigned more to sicker or healthier patients.
<!--I made some changes here just to clarify, since we talk about "interventional studies" later. Not all interventional studies are randomized (for example, phase I and phase II are usually not randomized).-->
In contrast, interventional or experimental studies assign treatments within a research framework.
In particular, randomized controlled trials are the gold-standard method for assessing the effects of an intervention.
Here, patients are randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions, allowing for much stronger interpretations to be drawn; however, data from these trials takes much longer to collect.
Both sources have proven to be important sources of information to the development of a rapid response to the COVID-19 crisis, but as the pandemic continues and more results become available from randomized controlled trials, more definitive answers are becoming available about proposed therapeutics.
Interventional clinical trials investigating possible therapeutics and combinations of therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 are presented in Figure @fig:ebm-trials.

The purpose of this review is to provide an evolving resource tracking the status of efforts to repurpose and develop drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. 
<!--We need to specify what the 4 strategies are here, if we keep this sentence. It looks like there are multiple ways to split them up.-->
We highlight four strategies that provide different paradigms for the identification of potential pharmaceutical treatments.
As results become available from additional clinical trials, we will continue to update this manuscript to keep pace with the current understanding of which therapeutics may be effective against SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19.
 
### Small Molecule Drugs and Clinical Responses to COVID-19

<!--I feel like the next 2 paragraphs should be in "Lessons from Prior HCoV Outbreaks," since it's not small molecule-specific. Alternatively, can add a small section specifically on drug repurposing.-->
A variety of symptom profiles with a range of severity are associated with COVID-19, many of which are not life-threatening.
A study of COVID-19 patients in a hospital in Berlin, Germany reported that the highest risk of death was associated with infection-related symptoms, such as sepsis, respiratory symptoms such as ARDS, and cardiovascular failure or pulmonary embolism [@doi:10.1101/2020.06.15.20131540].
Similarly, an analysis in Wuhan, China reported that respiratory failure (associated with ARDS) and sepsis/multi-organ failure accounted for 69.5% and 28.0% of deaths, respectively, among the 82 deceased patients studied [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0235458].
<!-- To Do: one-sentence mention of cytokine storm-->
Therapeutics to treat the most severe cases of COVID-19 are therefore urgently needed, and identifying strategies for treating patients is a priority for clinicians.
<!--This sentence is unfinished:-->
In the case of SARS and MERS, <!--To Do: Steroids?-->
In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians sought to identify potential treatments that could benefit patients, and in some cases shared their experiences and advice with the medical community on social media sites such as Twitter [@doi:10.7759/cureus.13594].
These on-the-ground treatment strategies could then be analyzed retrospectively in observational studies or investigated in an interventional paradigm through randomized control studies.

In addition to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as encouraging non-intubated patients to adopt a prone position [@doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.3030], knowledge about how HCoVs interact with the human body led to the suggestion that a number of common drugs might provide benefits for COVID-19 patients.
The administration and assessment of such treatments on a rapid time course was feasible because they are often either available in hospitals, or in some cases may also be prescribed to a large number of out-patients.
One of the other advantages is that these well-established compounds, if found to be beneficial, tend to be more widely available and less expensive than experimental drugs.
<!--I tried to reduce/streamline a bunch of the text here-->
Prior analyses of the virological and pathogenic properties of SARS-CoV-1 and _Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus_ (MERS-CoV) have also provided a strong foundation for the development of hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 that offered insight into potential therapeutic approaches.
Care for SARS and MERS patients prioritized supportive care and symptom management [@doi:10.1093/ajcp/aqaa029], however the smaller number of patients in these outbreaks made it more difficult to obtain good quality evidence for the treatment effectiveness, such as that from randomized clinical trials.
However, some of the treatments studies for SARS and MERS have been among the prime candidates for drug repurposing against COVID-19.

<!--To Do: Steroids for SARS? long-SARS patients have damage from high doses of steroids so there must have been some use of steroids...-->
Ribavirin is an antiviral drug effective against other viral infections that was often used in combination with corticosteroids and sometimes interferon (IFN) medications to treat SARS and MERS [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
However, analyses of its effects in retrospective and _in vitro_ analyses of SARS and the SARS-CoV-1 virus, respectively, have been inconclusive [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81], and while IFNs and ribavirin have shown promise in _in vitro_ analyses of MERS, their clinical effectiveness remains unknown [@doi:10.1038/nrmicro.2016.81].
Similarly, this medication was pursued for COVID-19, but retrospective cohort analysis comparing patients who did and did not receive ribivarin revealed no effect on the mortality rate [@doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106114].
Therefore, experience with prior severe threats from HCoVs provided some ideas of how to approach the treatment of COVID-19, but without guarantee of success.

Dexamethasone (9&alpha;-fluoro-16&alpha;-methylprednisolone) is a treatment adapted from prior HCoV outbreaks and currently the best known defense against death from COVID-19.
<!--To Do: look into exactly which steroids were used, why, when in illness course, and to what extent this included dexa-->
It is a synthetic corticosteroid that binds to glucocorticoid receptors [@doi:10.1021/cr068203e; @url:https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/dexamethasone/].
It functions as an anti-inflammatory agent by binding to glucocorticoid receptors with higher affinity than endogenous cortisol [@doi:10.1016/B978-0-323-48110-6.00034-X].
Dexamethasone and other steroids are widely available and affordable, and they are often used to treat community-acquired pneumonia [@doi:10.1038/s41392-020-0127-9].
Immunosuppressive drugs such as steroids are typically contraindicated in the setting of infection [@doi:10.1177/2040622313485275], but because COVID-19 results in hyperinflammation that appears to contribute to mortality via lung damage, immunosuppression may be a helpful approach to treatment [@doi:10/ggnzmc].
A clinical trial that began in 2012 recently reported that dexamethasone may improve outcomes for patients with ARDS [@doi:10/ggpxzc], but a meta-analysis of a small amount of available data about dexamethasone as a treatment for SARS suggested that it may, in fact, be associated with patient harm [@doi:10/ggks86].
However, the findings in SARS may have been biased by the fact that all of the studies examined were observational and a large number of inconclusive studies were not included [@doi:10/ggq356].

The questions of whether and when to counter hyperinflammation with immunosuppression in the setting of COVID-19 was an area of intense debate, as the risks of inhibiting antiviral immunity needed to be weighed against the beneficial anti-inflammatory effects [@doi:10/ggq8hs].
As a result, guidelines early in the pandemic typically recommended avoiding treating COVID-19 patients with corticosteroids such as dexamethasone [@doi:10/ggks86].
Despite this initial concern, dexamethasone was evaluated as part of the multi-site RECOVERY trial in the United Kingdom [@doi:10.1101/2020.06.22.20137273].
This study found that the 28-day mortality rate was lower in patients receiving dexamethasone than in those receiving standard of care (SOC).
However, this finding was driven by differences in mortality among patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation or supplementary oxygen at the start of the study.
The report indicated that dexamethasone reduced 28-day mortality relative to SOC in patients who were ventilated (29.3% versus 41.4%) and among those who were receiving oxygen supplementation (23.3% versus 26.2%) at randomization, but not in patients who were breathing independently (17.8% versus 14.0%).
These findings also suggested that dexamethasone may have reduced progression to mechanical ventilation, especially among patients who were receiving oxygen support at randomization.
Other analyses have supported the importance of disease course in determining the efficacy of dexamethasone: additional results suggest greater potential for patients who have experienced symptoms for at least seven days and patients who were not breathing independently [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2021436].
A meta-analysis that evaluated the results of the RECOVERY trial alongside trials of other corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, similarly concluded that corticosteroids may be beneficial to patients with severe COVID-19 who are receiving oxygen supplementation [@doi:10.1053/j.jvca.2020.11.057].
Thus, it seems likely that dexamethasone is useful for treating inflammation associated with immunopathy or cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is a condition caused by detrimental overactivation of the immune system [@individual-pathogenesis].
In fact, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are sometimes used to treat CRS [@doi:10.1182/blood-2014-05-552729].
This affordable and widely available treatment has since become a valuable tool against COVID-19,and <!--To Do: some stats on usage since RECOVERY came out-->.

Some of the most widely publicized analyses of whether a well-known medication could provide benefits to COVID-19 patients came from the assessment of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which are used for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria, as well as the treatment of lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis in adults [@dailymed-hcq].
These drugs are lysosomotropic agents, meaning they are weak bases that can pass through the plasma membrane, and it was thought that they might provide benefits against SARS-CoV-2 by interfering with the digestion of antigens within the lysosome and inhibiting CD4 T-cell stimulation while promoting the stimulation of CD8 T-cells [@doi:10.1111/j.1529-8019.2007.00131.x].
These compounds also have anti-inflammatory [@doi:10.1111/j.1529-8019.2007.00131.x] and can decrease the production of certain key cytokines involved in the immune response, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), and inhibit the stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and TLR signaling [@doi:10.1111/j.1529-8019.2007.00131.x].
_In vitro_ analyses reported that CQ inhibited cell entry of SARS-CoV-1 [@doi:10.1186/1743-422X-2-69] and that both CQ and HCQ inhibited viral replication within cultured cells [@doi:10.1093/cid/ciaa237], leading to early hope that it might provide similar therapeutic or protective effects in patients.
However, while the first publication on the clinical application of these compounds to the inpatient treatment of COVID-19 was very positive [@doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949], it was quickly discredited [@url:https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/official-isac-statement].
Over the following months, extensive evidence emerged demonstrating that CQ and HCQ offered no benefits for COVID-19 patients and, in fact, carried the risk of dangerous side effects (see Appendix XX).
Definitive evidence against HCQ came when findings from the large-scale RECOVERY trial were released on October 8, 2020.
This study enrolled 11,197 hospitalized patients and used a randomized, open-label design to study the effects of HCQ compared to SOC at 176 hospitals in the United Kingdom [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2022926].
Rates of COVID-19-related mortality did not differ between the control and HCQ arms, but patients receiving HCQ were slightly more likely to die due to cardiac events.
Patients who received HCQ also had a longer duration of hospitalization than patients receiving usual care and were more likely to progress to mechanical ventilation or death (as a combined outcome).
As a result, enrollment in the HCQ arm of the RECOVERY trial was terminated early [@url:https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/statement-from-the-chief-investigators-of-the-randomised-evaluation-of-covid-19-therapy-recovery-trial-on-hydroxychloroquine-5-june-2020-no-clinical-benefit-from-use-of-hydroxychloroquine-in-hospitalised-patients-with-covid-19].
The story of CQ/HCQ therefore illustrates how initial promising _in vitro_ analyses can fail to translate to a useful clinical approach, even for a drug that has been on the market for many years.

While CQ/HCQ are well-known medications that have long been prescribed in certain contexts, investigation of another well-established type of pharmaceutical was facilitated by the fact that it was already being taken by a large number of COVID-19 patients.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are among today's most commonly prescribed medications, often being used to control blood pressure [@url:https://clincalc.com/DrugStats/Drugs/Lisinopril; @doi:10.1056/NEJMp1901657].
In the United States, for example, they are prescribed well over 100,000,000 times annually [@doi:10.18553/jmcp.2010.16.9.671].
<!-- To Do: check ARBs/ACEIs and SARS/MERS and add a sentence if that was explored-->
Data from some animal models suggest that several, but not all, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and several ARBs increase ACE2 expression in the cells of some organs [@doi:10.1093/cvr/cvaa097], but clinical studies have not established whether plasma ACE2 expression is increased in humans treated with these medications [@doi:10.1093/europace/euw246].
In this case, rather than introducing ARBs/ACEIs, a number of analyses have investigated whether discontinuing use affects COVID-19 outcomes.
An initial observational study of the association of exposure to ACEIs or ARBs with outcomes in COVID-19 was retracted from the _New England Journal of Medicine_ [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2007621] due to concerns related to data availability [@doi:10.1056/nejmc2021225].
As randomized trials have become available, they have demonstrated no effect of continuing versus discontinuing ARBs/ACEIs on patient outcomes [@doi:10/fvgt; @doi:10.1001/jama.2020.25864] (Appendix XX).
Thus, once again, despite a potential mechanistic association with the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these medications were not found to influence the trajectory of COVID-19 illness.
However, because the medications were so widespread, clinical research was able to evaluate their efficacy very quickly.

### Manipulating the Immune Response with Biologics

In addition to clinical efforts to manage SARS and MERS, researchers have also made significant strides towards understanding SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV from a fundamental biological perspective, with some of the gained knowledge aiding our understanding of SARS-CoV-2.
<!--To Do: Synopsis of evolution of HCoV research from 2000 to 2020, possibly based on data from CoronaCentral?-->

Biologics are a particularly important class of drugs for efforts to address HCoV through this paradigm.
They are produced from components of living organisms or viruses and were historically produced primarily from animal tissues [@doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2009.10.006].
Biologics have become increasingly feasible to produce as recombinant DNA technologies have advanced [@doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2009.10.006].
Often, they are glycoproteins or peptides [@doi:10.2174/138920006774832604], but whole viruses can also be used therapeutically or prophylactically, not only for vaccines but also as vectors for gene therapy or therapeutic proteins or for oncolytic virotherapy [@doi:10.3390/jcm9040972].
They are typically catabolized by the body to their amino acid components [@doi:10.2174/138920006774832604].

There are many differences on the development side between biologics and synthesized pharmaceuticals, such as small molecule drugs.
Biologics are typically orders of magnitude larger than small molecule drugs, and their physiochemical properties are often much less understood [@doi:10.2174/138920006774832604].
They are often heat sensitive, and their toxicity can vary, as it is not directly associated with the primary effects of the drug [@doi:10.2174/138920006774832604].
However, this class includes some extremely significant medical breakthroughs, including insulin for the management of diabetes, as well as vaccines, interferons, and antibody treatments.
As a result, biologics offer an important avenue through which the pharmacological management of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be approached.

Treatments based on understanding a virus and/or how a virus interacts with the human immune system can fall into two categories: they can interact with the innate immune response, which is likely to be a similar response across viruses, or they can be specifically designed to imitate the adaptive immune response to a particular virus.
In the latter case, it can also be explored whether conservation of structure/behavior across viruses can allow for drugs developed for one virus to be useful in treating another.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of candidate therapeutics have been explored in these categories, with varied success.

#### Biologics and the Innate Immune Response

Deaths from COVID-19 often occur when inflammation becomes dysregulated following an immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Therefore, one potential approach to reducing COVID-19 mortality rates is to manage the inflammatory response in severely ill patients. 
One candidate therapeutic identified that uses this mechanism is tocilizumab (TCZ).
TCZ is a receptor antibody that was developed to manage chronic inflammation caused by the continuous synthesis of the cytokine IL-6 [@doi:10.1101/cshperspect.a016295].
IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the interleukin family, which is comprised by immune system regulators that are primarily responsible for immune cell differentiation.
Often used to treat chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis [@doi:10.1101/cshperspect.a016295], TCZ has become a pharmaceutical of interest for the treatment of COVID-19 because of the role IL-6 plays in this disease.
It has also been approved to treat CRS caused by CAR-T treatments [@dailymed-tocilizumab].
While secretion of IL-6 can be associated with chronic conditions, it is a key player in the innate immune response and is secreted by macrophages in response to the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns [@doi:10.1101/cshperspect.a016295].
An analysis of 191 in-patients at two Wuhan hospitals revealed that blood concentrations of IL-6 differed between patients who did and did not recover from COVID-19, and patients who ultimately died had higher IL-6 levels at admission than those who recovered [@doi:10/ggnxb3].
Additionally, IL-6 levels remained higher throughout the course of hospitalization in the patients who ultimately died [@doi:10/ggnxb3].

Currently, TCZ is being administered either as an intervention or as concomitant medication in {{ebm_tocilizumab_ct}} interventional COVID-19 clinical trials (Figure @fig:ebm-trials).
A number of retrospective studies have been conducted in several countries [@doi:10/d2pk; @doi:10.1016/j.chest.2020.06.006; @doi:10.1016/j.ejim.2020.05.009; @doi:10.1016/j.medmal.2020.05.001; @doi:10.1093/qjmed/hcaa206; 10.1073/pnas.2005615117], and, in general, these studies have reported a positive effect of TCZ on reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients, although due to their restrospective designs, significant limitations are present in all of them (see Appendix XX).
It wasn't until February 11, 2021 that a preprint describing the first randomized control trial of TCZ was released as part of the RECOVERY trial [@doi:10.1101/2021.02.11.21249258].
The first randomized control trial of TCZ to report results was the RECOVERY trial [@doi:10.1101/2021.02.11.21249258], in which 2,022 hospitalized patients in the U.K. were randomized to receive TCZ and 2,094 were randomized to SOC, with 79% of patients in each group available for analysis at the time that the initial report was released.
TCZ was found to reduce 28-day mortality, from 33% in patients receiving SOC alone to 29% in those receiving TCZ.
Combining the RECOVERY trial data with data from seven smaller randomized control trials indicates that TCZ is associated with a 13% reduction in 28-day mortality (rate ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.96, _p_ = 0·005) [@doi:10.1101/2021.02.11.21249258].
While this initial report did not include the full results expected from the RECOVERY trial, this large-scale, randomized controlled trial therefore offers strong evidence that TCZ may offer benefits for COVID-19 patients, even at this initial stage of analysis.
However, the fact that TCZ suppresses the immune response means that it does carry risks for patients, especially a potential risk of secondary infection (see Appendix XX).

TCZ is just one example of a candidate drug targeting the host immune response, and specifically excessive inflammation.
For example, interferons (IFNs) have also been investigated; these are a family of cytokines critical to activating the innate immune response against viral infections.
Synairgen has been investigating a candidate drug, SNG001, which is an IFN-𝛽-1a formulation to be delivered to the lungs via inhalation [@clinicaltrials:NCT04385095] that was associated with a reported reduced progression to ventilation in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study of 101 patients with an average age in the late 50s [@synairgen-SNG001-July-2020; @doi:10/ghjzm4].
However, these findings were not supported by the large-scale WHO Solidarity trial, which reported no significant effect of IFN-𝛽1a on patient survival during hospitalization [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2023184], although differences in the designs of the two studies, and specifically the severity of illness among enrolled patients, may have influenced their divergent outcomes (see Appendix XX).
Other drugs influencing inflammation are also being explored (see Appendix XX).<!-- To Do: Figure out what to cite from drugs in the potential alternate section-->
It is also important that studies focused on inflammation as a possible therapeutic target consider the potential differences in baseline inflammation among patients from different backgrounds and with differing life experiences (see [@individual-inequality]).

#### Biologics and the Adaptive Immune Response

One of the most positive revelations of the COVID-19 pandemic has been how much progress has been made towards a rapid scientific response to an emerging threat (see also [@individual-vaccines]).
In particular, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revolutionized the way we treat human diseases.
They have become some of the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market in recent years [@doi:10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z].
There are currently 79 FDA approved mAbs on the market, including antibodies for viral infections (e.g. ibalizumab for HIV and palivizumab for RSV) [@doi:10.1186/s12929-019-0592-z; @doi:10.1146/annurev-immunol-032712-095916].
Virus-specific neutralizing antibodies commonly target viral surface glycoproteins or host structures, thereby inhibiting viral entry through receptor binding interference [@doi:10.3389/fmicb.2017.02323; @doi:10.1080/21645515.2017.1337614].
This interference is predicted to reduce the viral load, mitigate disease, and reduce overall hospitalization.
mAbs can be designed for a particular virus, and significant advances have been made in the speed at which new mAbs can be identified and produced.

mAbs are, once again, an example of how scientific advances during the SARS epidemic have played a role in shaping the scientific response to COVID-19.
<!--Should introduce nAbs before using them (sorry, this is always a point of confusion for me!)-->
During the first SARS epidemic in 2002, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were found in SARS-CoV-1-infected patients [@doi:10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.01009.x; @doi:10.1086/423286].
Several studies following up on these findings identified various S-glycoprotein epitopes as the major targets of nAbs against SARS-CoV-1 [@doi:10.1517/14712590902763755].
Coronaviruses use trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins on their surface to bind to the host cell, allowing for cell entry [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058]. <!--Should cite pathogenesis paper here.-->
Each S glycoprotein protomer is comprised of an S1 domain, also called the receptor binding domain (RBD), and an S2 domain.
The S1 domain binds to the host cell while the S2 domain facilitates the fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes [@doi:10.1517/14712590902763755].
The genomic identity between the RBD of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is around 74% [@doi:10.1101/2020.02.16.951723].
Due to this high degree of similarity, preexisting antibodies against SARS-CoV-1 were initially considered candidates for neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2.
While some antibodies developed against the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein showed cross-neutralization activity with SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1016/j.tips.2020.07.004; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2349-y], others failed to bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at relevant concentrations [@doi:10.1126/science.abb2507].
Cross-neutralizing activities were dependent on whether the epitope recognized by the antibodies were conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1016/j.tips.2020.07.004].

Technological advances in antibody drug design as well as in structural biology massively accelerated the discovery of novel antibody candidates and the mechanisms by which they interact with the target structure.
In just under a year since the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was first published, an impressive pipeline of mAbs targeting SARS-CoV-2 has entered clinical trials, with hundreds more candidates in preclinical stages.
The first human monoclonal nAb specifically against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein was developed using hybridoma technology [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.11.987958], where antibody-producing B-cells developed by mice are inserted into myeloma cells to produce a hybrid cell line (the hybridoma) that is grown in culture.
The 47D11 antibody clone was able to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.
This antibody (now ABVV-47D11) has recently entered clinical trials in collaboration with AbbVie.
Additionally, an extensive monoclonal neutralizing antibody pipeline has been developed to combat the ongoing pandemic, with over 50 different antibodies in clinical trials [@doi:10.1016/j.bsheal.2021.02.001].
Thus far, two antibody cocktails (REGN-COV2 and LY-CoV555/LY-COV016) have been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA.

One promising combination treatment protocol is comprised of the mAbs bamlanivimab and estesevimab.
<!--Recovered from one or multiple recovered COVID-19 patients?-->
Bamlanivimab is a human monoclonal antibody that was derived from convalescent plasma donated by recovered COVID-19 patient, evaluated in research by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and subsequently developed by AbCellera and Eli Lilly.
The neutralizing activity of bamlanivimab was initially demonstrated _in vivo_ using a nonhuman primate model [@doi:10.1101/2020.09.30.318972].
In these studies, prophylactic Ly-CoV555 infusions protected rhesus macaques from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Based on the positive preclinical data, Eli Lilly initiated the first human clinical trial for a monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2.
The phase 1 trial, which was conducted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, was completed in August 2020 [@clinicaltrials:NCT04411628].
Estesevimab (LY-CoV016 or JS-016) is also a monoclonal neutralizing antibody against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.
It was initially developed by Junshi Biosciences and later licensed and developed through Eli Lilly.
A phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety of etesevimab was completed in October 2020 [@clinicaltrials:NCT04441931].
Etesevimab was shown to bind a different epitope on the spike protein than bamlanivimab, suggesting that the two antibodies used as a combination therapy would further enhance their clinical use compared to a monotherapy [@doi:10.1001/jama.2021.0202].
To assess the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab alone or in combination with etesevimab for the treatment of COVID-19, a phase 2/3 trial (BLAZE-1) [@clinicaltrials:NCT04427501] was initiated.
The interim analysis of the phase 2 portion suggested that bamlanivimab alone was able to reduce accelerate the reduction in viral load [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2029849].
However, more recent data suggests that only the bamlanivimab/etesevimab combination therapy is able to reduce viral load in COVID-19 patients [@doi:10.1001/jama.2021.0202].
Based on these data, the combination therapy received emergency use authorization for COVID-19 from the FDA in February of 2021.

Casirivimab and imdevimab (REGN-COV2) represent another antibody therapy combination against COVID-19.
Casirivimab (REGN10933) and imdevimab (REGN10987) are two monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
They were both developed by Regeneron in a parallel high-throughput screen to identify neutralizing antibodies from either humanized mice or patient-derived convalescent plasma [@doi:10.1126/science.abd0827].
In these efforts, multiple antibodies were characterized for their ability to bind and neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
The authors hypothesized that an antibody cocktail, rather than each individual antibody, could increase the therapeutic efficacy while minimizing the risk for virus escape.
Therefore, the authors tested pairs of individual antibodies for their ability to simultaneously bind the RBD of the spike protein.
Based on this data, casirivimab and imdevimab were identified as the lead antibody pair, resulting in the initiation of two clinical trials [@clinicaltrials:NCT04426695; @clinicaltrials:NCT04425629].
Data from this phase 1-3 trial published in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ shows that the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail reduced viral load, particularly in patients with high viral load or whose endogenous immune response had not yet been initiated [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2035002].
However, in patients who already initiated an immune response, exogenous addition of REGN-COV2 did not improve the endogenous immune response.
Both doses were well tolerated with no serious events related to the antibody cocktail.
Based on this data, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for REGN-COV2 in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at risk of developing severe disease.
Ongoing efforts are trying to evaluate the efficacy of REGN-COV2 to improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients [@clinicaltrials:NCT04426695].

Several potential limitations remain in the application of mAbs to the treatment of COVID-19.
One of the biggest challenges is identifying antibodies that not only bind to their target, but also prove to be beneficial for disease management.
Currently, use of mAbs is limited to people with mild to moderate disease that are not hospitalized, and it has yet to be determined whether monoclonal antibodies can be used as a successful treatment option for severe COVID patients.
While preventing people from developing severe illness provides significant benefits, patients with severe illness are at the greatest risk of death, and therefore therapeutics that provide benefits against severe illness are particularly desirable. 
It remains to be seen whether mAbs confer any benefits for patients in this category.

Another concern about therapeutics designed to amplify the response to a specific viral target is that they may need to be modified as the virus evolves.
With the ongoing global spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, there is a growing concern that mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could escape antibody neutralization, thereby reducing the efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapeutics and vaccines.
A comprehensive mutagenesis screen recently identified several amino acid substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that can prevent antibody neutralization [@doi:10.1016/j.chom.2021.01.014].
While some mutations result in resistance to only one antibody, others confer broad resistance to multiple monoclonal antibodies as well as polyclonal human sera, suggesting that some amino acids are “hotspots” for antibody resistance.
However, it was not investigated whether the resistant mutations identified result in a fitness advantage.
Accordingly, an impact on neutralizing efficiency has been reported for the emerging UK (B.1.1.7) and South Africa (B.1.351) variants [@doi:10.21203/rs.3.rs-228079/v1; @doi:10.1101/2021.02.03.429355; @doi:10.1101/2021.01.25.428137].
While the reported impact on antibody neutralization needs to be confirmed _in vivo_, it suggests that some adjustments to therapeutic antibody treatments may be necessary to maintain the efficacy that was reported in previous clinical trials.
Several strategies have been employed to try to mitigate this risk.
<!--It seems like there should be some references to these cocktails?-->
Antibody cocktails such as REGN-COV2, CT-P59, and AZD7442 have been developed to overcome the risk for attenuation of neutralizing activity of a single monoclonal antibody.
These cocktails consist of antibodies that recognize different epitopes on the spike protein, decreasing the likelihood that a single amino acid change can cause resistance to all antibodies in the cocktail.
However, neutralizing resistance can emerge even against an antibody cocktail if the individual antibodies target subdominant epitopes [@doi:10.1101/2021.02.03.429355].
Another strategy is to develop broadly neutralizing antibodies that target structures that are highly conserved, as these are less likely to mutate [@doi:10.1016/j.immuni.2007.11.018; @doi:10.1126/science.1171491] or to target epitopes that are insensitive to mutations [@doi:10.1016/j.vaccine.2006.04.054].
One such antibody (ADG-2) has recently been reported [@doi:10.1126/science.abf4830].
This antibody targets a highly conserved epitope that overlaps the hACE2 binding site of all clade 1 sarbecoviruses.
Prophylactic administration of ADG-2 in an immunocompetent mouse model of COVID-19 resulted in protection against viral replication in the lungs and respiratory burden.
Since the epitope targeted by ADG-2 represents an Achilles’ heel for clade 1 sarbecoviruses, this antibody might be a promising candidate against all circulating variants as well as emerging SARS-related coronaviruses.

Thus, the development of mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 has made it clear that this technology is rapidly adaptable and offers great potential in responding to emerging viral threats.
However, additional investigation may be needed to adapt mAb treatments to SARS-CoV-2 as it evolves and potentially to pursue designs that confer benefits for patients at the greatest risk of death.

### Small-Molecule Drugs Targeting Viral Structure and Behavior

Therapeutics that directly target the virus itself hold the potential to prevent people infected with SARS-CoV-2 from developing potentially damaging symptoms.
Such drugs typically fall into the broad category of antivirals.
Antiviral therapies hinder the spread of a virus within the host, rather than destroying existing copies of the virus, and these drugs can vary in their specificity to a narrow or broad range of viral targets.
This process requires inhibiting the replication cycle of a virus by disrupting one of six fundamental steps [@isbn:978-1405136457] (Figure @fig:therapeutics).
In the first of these steps, the virus attaches to and enters the host cell through endocytosis.
Then the virus undergoes uncoating, which is classically defined as the release of viral contents into the host cell.
Next, the viral genetic material enters the nucleus where it gets replicated during the biosynthesis stage.
During the assembly stage, viral proteins are translated, allowing new viral particles to be assembled.
In the final step new viruses are released into the extracellular environment.
Many antiviral drugs are designed to inhibit the replication of viral genetic material during the biosynthesis step.
Unlike DNA viruses, which can use the host enzymes to propagate themselves, RNA viruses like SARS-CoV-2 depend on their own polymerase, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), for replication [@doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-2438-7; @doi:10.1002/jmv.25761].
Targeting the RdRP is therefore an effective strategy for antivirals against RNA viruses and is the proposed mechanism underlying the treatment of SARS and MERS with Ribavirin [@doi:10.1080/17460441.2019.1581171].
However, although antivirals are designed to target a virus, they can also impact other processes in the host and may have unintended effects.
Therefore, these therapeutics must be evaluated for both efficacy and safety.
As the technology to respond to emerging viral threats has also evolved over the past two decades, a number of candidate treatments have been identified for prior viruses that may be relevant to the treatment of COVID-19.

Nucleotides and nucleosides are the natural building blocks for RNA synthesis, and nucleoside and nucleotide analogs have been explored in the past for their potential to inhibit viral replication.
Analogs containing modifications to nucleotides or nucleosides can disrupt key processes including replication [@doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.04.004].
A single incorporation does not influence RNA transcription; however, multiple events of incorporation lead to the arrest of RNA synthesis [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068347].
One candidate antiviral considered for the treatment of COVID-19 is favipiravir (Avigan), also known as T-705, which was discovered by Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd. [@url:https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB12466].
It was previously found to be effective at blocking viral amplification in several influenza subtypes as well as other RNA viruses, such as _Flaviviridae_ and _Picornaviridae_, through a reduction in plaque formation [@doi:10.1128/AAC.46.4.977-981.2002] and viral replication in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells [@doi:10.1128/AAC.01051-06].
Favipiravir (6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide) acts as a purine and purine nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral RNA polymerase in a dose-dependent manner across a range of RNA viruses, including influenza viruses [@doi:10.1128/AAC.49.3.981-986.2005; @doi:10.1128/AAC.01074-08; @doi:10.1128/AAC.00356-07; @doi:10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.07.034; @doi:10.1128/AAC.01219-10].
Biochemical experiments showed that favipiravir was recognized as a purine nucleoside analogue and incorporated into the viral RNA template.
In 2014, the drug was approved in Japan for the treatment of influenza that was resistant to conventional treatments like neuraminidase inhibitors [@doi:10.2183/pjab.93.027].
Though initial analyses of favipiravir in observational studies of its effects on COVID-19 patients were promising, recent results of two small randomized control trials suggest that it is unlikely to affect COVID-19 outcomes (Appendix XX).
In contrast, sufficient evidence is has been identified in favor of another nucleoside analog, remdesivir, that it is one of the few treatments that has received FDA approval.
Remdesivir (GS-5734) is an intravenous antiviral that was proposed by Gilead Sciences as a possible treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD).
It is metabolized to GS-441524, an adenosine analog that inhibits a broad range of polymerases and then evades exonuclease repair, causing chain termination [@doi:10.1074/jbc.AC120.013056; @doi:10.1128/mBio.00221-18; @doi:10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0].
Gilead received an EUA for remdesivir from the FDA early in the pandemic (May 2020) based on the results of two clinical trials [@clinicaltrials:NCT04292899; @clinicaltrials:NCT04280705; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2007764; @doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2007016] and was later found to reduce mortality and recovery time in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical trial performed at 60 trial sites, 45 of which were in the United States [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2007764; @clinicaltrials:NCT04280705].
Subsequently, the WHO Solidarity trial, a large-scale, open-label trial enrolling 11,330 adult in-patients at 405 hospitals in 30 countries around the world reported no effect of remdesivir on in-hospital mortality, duration of hospitalization, or progression to mechanical ventilation [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2023184].
Therefore, additional clinical trials of remdesivir in different patient pools and in combination with other therapies may be needed to refine its use in the clinic and determine the forces driving these differing results.
Remdesivir is therefore thought to provide proof of principle that SARS-CoV-2 can be targeted at the level of viral replication, since remdesivir targets the viral RNA polymerase at high potency.
However, the relative success of remdesivir compared to favipiravir underscores the fact that drugs with similar mechanisms will not always produce similar results in clinical trials.

### Computational Approaches to Designing or Identifying Therapeutics

As illustrated by the difference in the current status of remdesivir and favipiravir as treatments for COVID-19, identifying specific compounds that will produce a desired interaction with a virus is challenging.
<!-- To Do: 1 paragraph background on how computational prediction works and why it's feasible now than in 2002 or 2011-->
<!-- To Do: Is this primarily small molecule or also biologics? Need to be explicit about this-->

In the current COVID-19 pandemic, computational efforts to screen or produce compounds have been applied to a few different challenges.
One builds on the same concept as the antivirals described above: several studies have shown that viral proteases play an important role in the life cycle of viruses, including coronaviruses, by modulating the cleavage of viral polyprotein precursors [@doi:10.2174/138161207780162971].
Serine protease inhibitors were previously suggested for the treatment of SARS and MERS viruses [@doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.01.011].
Recently, a study [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052] suggested that camostat mesylate, an FDA-approved protease inhibitor, could block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into lung cells _in vitro_.
<!--Can we introduce what a Michael acceptor inhibitor is?-->
Computer-aided design allowed for the development of a Michael acceptor inhibitor, now known as N3, to target a protease critical to SARS-CoV-2 replication.
Discovery of the N3 mechanism arose from interest in the two polyproteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 replicase gene, pp1a and pp1ab, that are critical for viral replication and transcription [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y].
These polyproteins must undergo proteolytic processing.
This processing is usually conducted by Mpro, a 33.8-kDa SARS-CoV-2 protease that is therefore fundamental to viral replication and transcription.
N3 was designed computationally [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0030324] to bind in the substrate binding pocket of the Mpro protease of SARS-like coronaviruses [@doi:10.1007/s13238-013-2841-3], therefore inhibiting proteolytic processing.
Subsequently, the structure of N3-bound SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was solved [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y], confirming the computational prediction.
N3 was tested _in vitro_ on SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, which belong to a line of cells established from the kidney epithelial cells of an African green monkey, and was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y].
After the design and confirmation of N3 as a highly potent Michael acceptor inhibitor and the identification of Mpro's structure [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y; @doi:10.1126/science.abb3405], 10,000 compounds were screened for their _in vitro_ anti-Mpro activity.
Six leads were identified, and _in vitro_ analysis revealed that ebselen, an organoselenium compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [@doi:10.1007/s11033-014-3417-x], had the strongest potency in reducing the viral load in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y].
Ebselen is an organoselenium compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [@doi:10.1007/s11033-014-3417-x]; however, it is likely to be a promiscuous binder, which could diminish its therapeutic potential [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2223-y].
While there is clear computational and _in vitro_ support for ebselen's potential as a COVID-19 therapeutic, results from clinical trials are not yet available for this compound.

### Considerations in Balancing Different Approaches

<!-- To Do: This is a very rough sketch-->
The four approaches described here can all offer advantages in the development of a response to a novel viral threat.

Building on information gained in the clinic in treating related diseases provides an opportunity to mount a response with the intention of saving the lives of patients already infected.
Oftentimes, the pharmaceutical agents that fall into this category are small-molecule, broad-spectrum pharmaceuticals that are widely available and affordable to produce.
Small molecules are synthesized compounds of low molecular weight, typically less than 1 kilodalton (kDa) [@url:https://www.nuventra.com/resources/blog/small-molecules-versus-biologics/].
Small-molecule pharmaceutical agents have been a backbone of drug development since the discovery of penicillin in the early twentieth century [@doi:10.1126/science.287.5460.1960].
It and other antibiotics have long been among the best known applications of small molecules to therapeutics, but biotechnological developments such as the prediction of protein-protein interactions have facilitated advances in precise targeting of specific structures using small molecules [@doi:10.1126/science.287.5460.1960].
Small molecule drugs today encompass a wide range of therapeutics beyond antibiotics, including antivirals, protein inhibitors, and many broad-spectrum pharmaceuticals.
Broad-spectrum treatments are not specifically targeted at a virus or at particular host receptors, but rather induce broad shifts in host biology that are hypothesized to be potential inhibitors of the virus.
Instead, when a virus enters a host, the host becomes the virus's environment, and, therefore, the state of the host can also influence the virus's ability to replicate and spread.
In most cases, interest in particular candidate medications arises because they are already available for other purposes and clinicians are able to administer them to patients quickly.
However, the fact that the targets of these agents are non-specific means that the mechanism of action can appear to be relevant to COVID-19 without a therapeutic or prophylactic effect being observed in clinical trials.
Over the last year, dexamethasone has emerged as the strongest treatment against severe COVID-19, but ARBs/ACEis have not borne out early hopes in their potential.
Given that it is used to treat ARDS, the clinical relevance of this drug to the COVID-19 symptomatology is clear.
The dexamethasone story clearly illustrates how clinical context can be a valuable approach through which to identify candidate therapeutics.

An alternative strategy in the COVID-19 pandemic has been to identify candidate pharmaceuticals based on information gained in research on prior HCoVs. 
These approaches often involve biologics that have been developed to imitate the function of endogenous compounds.
To date, biologics have been explored that imitate IL-6 and <!--To Do: finish summary-->
Once again, this approach does not require the development of compounds specifically designed for the emergent viral threat.
However, once again, these compounds have shown varying success.
<!--To Do: Summarize 2 & 3-->

Finally, computational approaches can allow for the rapid screening of a large number of compounds to identify those most likely to display a desired behavior or function.
However, this approach focuses on modeling interactions between a compound and a virus rather than their observed interactions.
These compounds also may lack some of the benefits of other categories; for example, computationally designed compounds typically lack safety information, whereas for more established therapeutics, a general understanding of the drug's safety in other contexts may be available prior to the beginning of clinical trials.

The all-hands-on-deck approach that the scientific community has taken towards the COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated an unprecedented breadth of research into an emerging viral threat.
Experience gained through prior outbreaks of HCoVs combined with recent scientific advances in other fields ranging from <!--To Do: OK I can actually only think of examples from vaccines?--> to high-performance computing have enabled the rapid assessment of candidate drugs using a number of different approaches.
The combination of these approaches is likely to provide additional benefits beyond those apparent in trials of single drugs.
For example, traditionally, viral targets have been favored for pharmaceutical interventions because altering host processes is likely to be less specific than targeting the virus directly [@doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.03.020]; but on the other hand, targeting the host offers potential for a complementary strategy to antivirals that could broadly limit the ability of viruses to replicate [@doi:10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.03.020].
As more clinical trials become available, greater insights into which drugs are particularly suited to COVID-19 will become more clear.
However, the current crisis has underscored how different areas of biomedical research working in concert can produce a multi-pronged approach to tackling an emergent viral threat.
